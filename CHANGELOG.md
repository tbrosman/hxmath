## 0.17.0 (6/20/2020)
* Minor: Make Vector2.rotate actually use the sin/cos it calculates.
* Move type definitions to single file. (@Yanrishatum)
* Breaking change: Changed Matrix2x2 and Matrix3x2's multiplication convention to be compatible with Heaps and OpenFL.

## 0.16.0 (5/25/2019)
* Haxe 4 support

## 0.15.0 (04/14/2016)
* Fixed the DenseArray2 constructor so that it takes a default value. (issue #46)

## 0.14.0 (03/16/2016)
* Made ShortVector2's components unsettable. (issue #45)
* Added in-place set() functions to all math structures (except ShortVector2 which is not settable in-place). (issue #43)
* Added toString for Frame defaults. (issue #36)
* Added ordered iteration for SparseArray2. (issue #42)
* [breaking change] Changed DenseArray2.resize to always take a default value (issue #41).
* Fixed DenseArray2.resize (issue #40).
* orient2d allocates on some platforms due to use of enum. (issue #38)
* IntVector2 should not implicitly convert to Vector2. (issue #39)
* When wrapping angles, avoid relying on the target platform using a spcific sign convention for modulo. In the case of C++, for example, the convention isn't even specified in the standard.

## 0.13.0 (08/12/2015)
* Added all appropriate Vector2 functions to IntVector2 and ShortVector2.
* Lookup by packed key, iteration by key for DenseArray2.
* Completed conversion/clone functions for DenseArray2 and SparseArray2.
* fill for DenseArray2.
* intMin/Max now in MathUtil.

## 0.12.0 (07/29/2015)
* Haxe 3.2.0 support

## 0.11.0 (03/23/2015)
### Performance improvements
* Added in-place operators wherever possible to Vector classes to reduce new allocations (issue #23)
* [breaking change] Fixed the abstract signatures to use *Type instead of *Default, removed some random includes added by FlashDevelop, and finally added the option to use OpenFL types as inner types (issue #17). To use this feature use HXMATH_USE_OPENFL_STRUCTURES. Note that this change (6cd6c97) means that auto-casting will no longer "just work" even if HXMATH_USE_DYNAMIC_STRUCTURES is specified (no longer supported). This decision was made due to the massive performance gain on native platforms when using static types.
* [breaking change] Changed the inner type in Quaternion to be a flat structure (no more inner Vector3) (issue #33). The product isn't as clean, but it should be faster (especially when it comes to the GC).

### New features
* Vector functions from Unity3D. See https://github.com/tbrosman/hxmath/issues/30#issuecomment-78432760 for a table mapping Unity functions to hxmath equivalents. Additions include orthoNormalize, slerp, projectOntoPlane, and more.
* Array2 with two implementations (Sparse and Dense) (issue #3). Not really math, but extremely useful for things like tilemaps and grid collision.
* ShortVector2, an int vector with 16-bit fields implemented as an abstract over Int. It requires no allocation to "construct."

### Misc
* Added toString defaults for all structures (issue #21).

## 0.10.0 (01/17/2015)
* Partially implemented new conventions to reduce new allocations/increase performance (issue #23):
  * Operators will allocate new objects for clarity
  * Properties will normally allocate new objects (e.g. Vector2.normal)
  * All other functions will favor in-place versions where possible/practical
* Renamed scalarMultiply on vectors to just multiply for clarity.
* Added to Vector2: normalizeTo, clamp, divide, rotate (issue #29)
* Changed Frame3 to use a fully normalized quaternion inverse to avoid issues when inverting denormalized (e.g. interpolated) frames (issue #24).
* In-place quaternion inverse with normalization (issue #25).
* Fix for Quaternion clone doesn't clone its vector portion (issue #27).
* Fast inversion for frame matrices (frameMatrixInvert)
* Added Rect, the first of the geom structures.

## 0.8.0 (08/22/2014)
* Bugfix: Changed the cross product operator to '%' to avoid non-obvious precedence issues (Quaternion product was broken as a result).
* Added Frame3 for 3D transformations.

## 0.7.0 (08/20/2014)
* For core math structures: changed all underlying types to be static and removed default constructors. This is a huge performance gain for static targets like C++.
* Refactored coordinate frames to allow for implicit frames (adapters over existing sprites/entities with minimal overhead).

## 0.6.0 (08/12/2014)
* Bugfix: isDirty bit never set to false in Frame2 (matrix not being cached).

## 0.5.0 (08/11/2014)
* 2D coordinate frames have been added. They can be concatenated, inverted, used either to transform points/vectors directly or used as a way to generate OpenFL-compatible matrices. They provide a higher (and more useful) layer of abstraction than matrices along with an intuitive 'to/from' syntax describing whether the point/vector is being transformed into the frame from the outer frame, etc. A bug in the equality operators (throwing on null) has been fixed. Documentation has been added for all public members.

## 0.4.0 (08/07/2014)
* To/from conversion functions for FlxPoint/FlxVector (by shape; no dependency on Flixel).
* copyTo functions to preserve the other properties of target types/avoid allocating when undesired.

## 0.3.0 (08/02/2014)
* Signed and unsigned angle functions for 2D vectors.
* Array operator overloads for all structures.

## 0.2.0 (07/28/2014)
* Minor bugfixes, more test coverage.

## 0.1.0 (07/27/2014)
* Initial version. Basic functionality for vectors, matrices, and quaternions working.
